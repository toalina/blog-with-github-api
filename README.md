# Week Seven - MEAN Stack II

Last week we focussed on CRUD with Mongo, Node, and Angular. This week we're going to focus on using Angular to build a strictly client-side app, leveraging third-party APIs. You'll be expected to build on knowledge you've already learned and produce a "mobile" weather app for your assignment this week.

We want this assignment to feel like a 'week on the job.' And by that we mean, we will provide a completed comp and an expected outcome specification as well as incrementally increasing scope! We'll be adding requirements throughout the week, on top of those listed here.

## The Comp

You can download the view that you are to complete [here](https://github.com/SEA-Design-Dev/mean-stack-2/tree/master/comps). There are no layers. I have provided an icon font as well as SVG icons.

## The spec

As a product owner, I need a functional prototype of the application. The final prototype must be visible in a mobile browser. 

Prototype is to use best practices in coding HTML/CSS as there is the potential that some or all of the code will made it into production. 

Aside from images as content, all visual assets should be produced via CSS or typography. 

[app functionality spec] - location API

### Requirements 

1. Semantically correct HTML is required as this will be the model for prod app integration
1. Think in terms of '*components*'; if all parts of the UI were lego blocks, who would you code that?
1. All CSS measurements should use elastic units unless a pixel specific unit is required for both mobile and desktop
1. JavaScript code is expected to be written cleanly and maintainably using the best practices covered during lectures
1. Write up a description for every plugin used (no limit, but you must justify them)
  1. jQuery is not allowed. Angular's built-in DOM manipulation can manage most of what you'd need jQuery for.

### Constraints 

1. Must work in all major browsers of latest versions;
	* Desktop (IE Edge, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox)
  * Mobile (iOS 8+, Android)
1. All interactions must be clearly functional
1. All code must pass HTML Tidy, CSS Lint, and JSHint.

__DO NOT__ fence yourself in with invisible constraints. Unless it is specifically listed and/or we discussed it in lecture, there is not an expectation to meet an objective that has not been set. 

## The expectation 

In this assignment, you should be able to demonstrate mastery of Angular as a platform for building client-side applications, including interacting with APIs. We're looking for you to build on best practices that you've already learned (proper HTML and CSS) as well as incorporate the new practices discussed during the course of the week.
